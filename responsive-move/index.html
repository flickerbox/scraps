				<h3>Let's Talk Benefits</h3>
				<p>Platfora offers amazing benefits, including a top-shelf health-care plan, 401(k), free shuttle service if you take Caltrain, free parking if you don’t. And food. Lots of food—free lunches on many days, a seemingly infinite array of snacks every day, and on the occasions when you can’t tear yourself away from the office, free dinners and Friday cocktail hours, too.</p>
				<p class="outro">No one changes the world on an empty stomach.</p>

		<p>The companies that create better, faster, easier ways to extract insight are the ones that will help shape the future. </p>
		<p>At Platfora we’re doing that. Right now.</p>
		<p>Sure, there are lots of other big data companies out there. Good ones, too. But our technology is fundamentally different. We’re the only platform that can truly leverage 100% of a company’s big data. The other guys? They’re looking at only 10%.</p>
		<p>So if you see as much potential in all of these things as we do, if you have an appetite for helping others find more meaning and get more understanding, if you’d rather be digging deeper into big data and not just scratching the surface—then guess what... </p>
